# Terminal_from_scratch
Creating my own terminal from scratch using Golang


## Simple Shell
- This is a simple command-line shell implementation in `Go`. It supports basic commands such as echo, type, and the execution of other system commands. You can also define your own custom commands.

## Basic Commands:
- exit: Exit the shell.
- echo <message>: Print the provided message to the console.
- type <command>: Check if the command is built-in or exists in the system's PATH.
- Custom Command Execution: A placeholder for executing a custom script (program_1234), which takes two arguments: a name and a code.
## Installation
Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
